# Wintergatan Timing Data Analysis

The community has long since clamoured for automatic peak detection and generation of timing data for the Wintergata Marble Machine project. An offhand comment during the 2023 Community Meetup colalesced into this project.

## View the live version

A live workflow for detection and generation of timing data is live at [https://wtg.mcnulty.in](https://wtg.mcnulty.in)

There is a 100M file size limit, and working data will be removed after 7 days on disk.


## Getting Started

The main.py file in the top-level of this repository is the best file for use locally and testing. The `web/` directory contains the versions currently deployed onto the mcnulty.in endpoint.

### Prerequisites

Currently no automated way of installing requirements is available. Check the `import` statements in the head of app/main.py
